Homework 2 (Ruby on Rails)
Tour Management System

Admin:

    Preconfigured admin username: john@john.com 
    Preconfigured admin password: john

Landing Page:

    We assume that the user lands on the landing page, where he/she can then login and accomplish the tasks.
    That is, we assume that the user will never type a URL like ".../photos" into their web browser.
    Every user has the same login page which is also the landing page.
    The user can either login and gain more functionality or they can see only the list of all tours and reviews.
    We are using the same login page to redirect a user to same user dashboard, but this dashboard has been customized to show only the relevant links to the user.

How To:

    All of these instructions assume that you are starting from the landing page.
