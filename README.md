# Tour Management System
**CSC517_HW02
Homework 2 (Ruby on Rails)**


### Web Application deployment:
https://young-fortress-53892.herokuapp.com/

### Admin:

    Preconfigured admin username: john@john.com 
    Preconfigured admin password: john_password
    
**NOTE: To find a list of known bugs, please look at the end of this Readme document.**  
    
### Testing:

    To accomplish the various tasks in this application please see the various "how to" instructions.

### Landing Page:


    The app assumes that all visitors start on the same page.
    Tacit in that assumption is that the user will never type a URL like
    ".../photos" into their web browser.

    From the log-in page, a visitor may login to gain more functionality, 
    or they can see only the list of all tours and reviews.
    We are using the same login page to redirect all users to same user
    dashboard, but this dashboard has been customized to show only the relevant
    links to the user.
    
### App Interactions:

    Users interact with the app depending on their role. There are currently 
    four roles, each with an increasing ability to perform functions. The 
    four roles are visitors, customers, agents, and admins.
    
    Visitors are users of the system who have not logged into the system. 
    They are limited to browsing tours, browsing reviews, and creating an 
    account.

    Customers are users of the system who have registered with the system (as
    a customer) and have logged into the system. In addition to browsing 
    tours and reviews, customers can bookmark tours of interest, review tours
    that have completed, and book tours.
    
    Agents are users of the system who have registered with the system 
    (as an agent) and have logged into the system. Agents are able to 
    create tours, create locations, and can examine aggregate statistics 
    about the tours they have created (bookmarks, bookings, reviews, etc).
    
    The admin is a unique, preconfigured user that can perform all of the tasks
    that the other users can perform. The admin cannot change his password or
    username, but uniquely can create new users (customers or agents).

    Details about the roles of the different users and the steps required
    to perform diffeent tasks are outlined below.

        How to perform this task:

    How to create a review (practical testing tips)
    
        Per the requirements:
            "Only future tours can be booked for... [customers may] Submit a
            review for a tour that that customer has already taken"
            Piazza further clarifies that "already taken" means that the tour
            has already ended.
        So, how to create a review in a practical time frame for testing?
        We have found that the following strategy works:
            - Create a tour that takes place in the future
            - Book a seat on this tour
            - Use DB tools to alter the tour dates such that it is a past tour
            - Create a review for the tour
        Alternatively, you could test tour creation and booking one day,
        and reviews the next.
            - In this strategy, make the tour just one day in duration

### Miscellaneous Notes:

    Testing:
    
        RSpec
        
            Per the requirements:
                Thoroughly test one model and one controller (prefer RSpec
                testing framework). Tests should cover all functions and handle
                all test cases, including edge cases.
            
            We chose RSpec testing of the locations controller and the bookmarks
            model. RSpec specifications can be found in 'spec/controllers' and
            'spec/models' directories, respectively. We used the 'simplecov' gem
            to assess the coverage of the modules.
            Contoller results:
                13 examples, 0 failures, 13 passed, 100% coverage
            Model results:
                9 examples, 0 failures, 9 passed, 100% coverage 
            
        Minitest
        
            Tests can be found in 'test/controllers' and 'test/models'
            directories.
            We have chosen NOT to focus our Minitest testing.
            Instead, we test a broader set of controllers and models in a
            slightly more shallow way.
            Controller results:
                80 tests, 108 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
            Model results:
                14 tests, 38 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
            
    Tour Operator Contact Info:
    
        Per Piazza:
            "...we have to create operator with some basic info?"
            "Agent information should be fine."
        This is a good idea and if we were starting over we likely would use
        agent profile information.
        However we already had a field for adding custom operator contact info
        when creating a tour.
        We have chosen to retain our custom contact info in the interest of
        flexibility.
        
    Price Filtering:
    
        Per Piazza:
            "...Is it acceptable to filter just by maximum price?"
            "There are no restrictions on the way you would like to implement
            any functionality."
        We offer price filtering by maximum price, but not by minimum price.
        This is on the theory that cheaper is always better (all else being
        equal).
    
    Booking / Waitlisting:
    
        There is no maximum value for the waitlist size.
        
        Instead of forcing the user to go through extra steps when
        "some, but not enough, seats are available", 
        we show the user how many seats areavailable and allow them to select among the following:
        "Book All Seats" / "Book Available Seats, Waitlist Remaining Seats" / "Waitlist All Seats".
        If the user selects an inappropriate option given the number of available seats,
        then they are instructed as to what went wrong.
        
        As noted in the requirements, if a customer cancels or reduces a booking,
        or if a customer cancels their account,
        waitlisted customers are enrolled in applicable tours.

    Enforcement of User Roles:
    
        As noted in "User Roles" different types of users have different
        privileges.
        Because there is often more than one way to access a given feature,
        we centralized the logic related to user roles and privileges.
        This logic can be found in app/helpers/sessions_helper.rb

    Locations:
    
        Locations are case sensitive. So, "NC, USA" is treated differently than
        "nc, USA". Be careful when adding a new location.
        
    "Extra" Model:

        Our E/R Diagram can be found at
        doc/CSC517_HW02_EntityRelationshipDiagram.png
        We have a "start_at" model that we ended up never really using.
        Instead, we find the start location for a tour based on order of records
        stored in the "visits" model.
        Time did not permit cleaning up this 'extra' code.
        
    "Extra" Views:
    
        We used scaffolding to start our application, which creates many views.
        Some of these views are never actually available to the user via a link.
        Most of these 'extra' views are retained:
            for time constraints
            for future development on the application if needed
            
### Record Deletion FAQs:

    Here we discuss side effects of deleting certain kinds of records through the web application.
    We only discuss records that are visible to the user (tours, reviews, etc).
    We do not explicitly discuss other records that may exist "in the background" to support the application.

    1. What happens when a USER is deleted?
    
        The following information is deleted:
        
            * Bookmarks created by the user
            * Reviews created by the user
            * Bookings spots created by the user
                If this frees up tour spots, 
                other customers may be enrolled as noted in "Booking / Waitlisting"
            * Waitlist spots created by the user
            
        The following information is NOT deleted:
        
            * Tours created by the user
                such tours will no longer have an agent listed for them
            * Photos created by the user
            * Locations created by the user
    
    2. What happens when an ADMIN USER is deleted?
    
        Trick question: Admin account cannot be deleted!
    
    3. What happens when a BOOKMARK is deleted?
    
        No other information is deleted as a side effect of deleting a bookmark.
    
    4. What happens when a TOUR is deleted?
    
        The following information is deleted:

            * Reviews of the tour
            * Booking / Waitlists spots for the tour
            * Photos of the tour
            
        The following information is NOT deleted:
        
            * Locations visited by the tour
    
    5. What happens when a REVIEW is deleted?
    
        No other information is deleted as a side effect of deleting a review.

            * Bookmarks created by the same user for the same tour
            * Booking / Waitlist spots created by the same user for the same tour
    
    6. What happens when a BOOKING is deleted?
    
        Please see "Booking / Waitlisting" for a full explanation.
            
        The following information is NOT deleted:
        
            * Bookmarks created by the same user for the same tour

    8. What happens when a LOCATION is deleted?
    
        No other information is deleted as a side effect of deleting a location.
            
        Specifically, the following information is NOT deleted:
        
            * Tours that visit this location
                (tour itinerary will no longer include this location)
    
    9. What happens when a PHOTO is deleted?
    
        No other information is deleted as a side effect of deleting a photo.
        
### Small Known Bugs:

    Every software organization releases software with a few small known bugs (nothing is perfect)!
    Rather than hoping nobody will notice, here we openly state the few small bugs of which we are aware.
    
    1. Repeated Tour in Tour Index View
    
        If you create a tour which visits the same location multiple times,
        then you "Show All Tours" and filter by desired location,
        you will see the same tour listed multiple times.
    
    2. Inappropriate Tour Booking Deadline
    
        It is possible to create a tour whose booking deadline is after the tour's start date.
    
    3. No confirmation required to delete records
    
        It is possible to delete a record (tour, review, etc.) without having to answer an "Are you sure?" prompt.
        
    4. Broken photo links
    
        It is possible that a photo uploaded by one user may not be visible to another user.
        
    5. Ease of forgetting "Create Bookmark" step
    
        See "How to bookmark a tour"
        The "Create Bookmark" step at the end of the process is easy to forget.
        
    6. User with no special role
    
        It is possible to create a user who is neither an agent nor a customer.
        Such a user can do very little that is useful.
